# ODP-Notebook-Tests
Testing notebooks for HUB Oceans Ocean Data Platform

## Fiskeridirektoratet Aquaculture production data
In these two notebooks, we test transforming some data from the Norwegian Fiskeridirektoratet into a format that is suitable for data analysis and then uploading it to the Ocean Data Platform using the tabular storage controller. We then test pulling that data from ODP and giving users some tools to do some simple analysis. The two notebooks you need are:
- [Transform and Upload Aquaculture Production Data](https://github.com/tomredd/ODP-Notebook-Tests/blob/f4c30c5e79908ebc22adeb9c7909d4c0098b2f4b/Transform%20and%20Upload%20Aquaculture%20Production%20Data.ipynb)
- [Playing with Production Data](https://github.com/tomredd/ODP-Notebook-Tests/blob/dcd8ad027eac8b5e9bead59cca1fe2218511ec92/Fiskeridirektoratet/Playing%20with%20Production%20Data.ipynb)
